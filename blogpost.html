        <p class="font2">Hair loss, also known as alopecia or baldness, refers to a loss of hair from part of the head
            or body.[2] Typically at least the head is involved.[4] The severity of hair loss can vary from a small area
            to the entire body.[7] Inflammation or scarring is not usually present.[4] Hair loss in some people causes
            psychological distress.[3]</p>

        <p class="font2">Common types include male- or female-pattern hair loss, alopecia areata, and a thinning of hair
            known as telogen effluvium.[4] The cause of male-pattern hair loss is a combination of genetics and male
            hormones; the cause of female pattern hair loss is unclear; the cause of alopecia areata is autoimmune; and
            the cause of telogen effluvium is typically a physically or psychologically stressful event.[4] Telogen
            effluvium is very common following pregnancy.[4]</p>

        <p class="font2">Less common causes of hair loss without inflammation or scarring include the pulling out of
            hair, certain medications including chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, hypothyroidism, and malnutrition including iron
            deficiency.[3][4] Causes of hair loss that occurs with scarring or inflammation include fungal infection,
            lupus erythematosus, radiation therapy, and sarcoidosis.[3][4] Diagnosis of hair loss is partly based on the
            areas affected.[4]</p>

        <p class="font2">eatment of pattern hair loss may simply involve accepting the condition, which can also include
            shaving one's head.[4] Interventions that can be tried include the medications minoxidil (or finasteride)
            and hair transplant surgery.[5][6] Alopecia areata may be treated by steroid injections in the affected
            area, but these need to be frequently repeated to be effective.[4] Hair loss is a common problem.[4] Pattern
            hair loss by age 50 affects about half of men and a quarter of women.[4] About 2% of people develop alopecia
            areata at some point in time.[4]</p>
